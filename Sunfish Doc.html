<h1 id="sunfish-openfabrics-management-framework-for-composable-disaggregated-infrastructures-">Sunfish OpenFabrics Management Framework for Composable Disaggregated Infrastructures <!-- omit from toc --></h1>
<p>Version 0.3</p>
<p><strong>ABSTRACT:</strong> Sunfish is designed for managing composable disaggregated resources over multiple fabrics using a central repository and an open-source API and toolset. Sunfish is designed for manipulating connected hardware resources using client-friendly RESTful abstractions and configuring fabric interconnects so that datacenter and AI workloads can be linked with available resources over dynamic fabric infrastructures.</p>
<p>The Sunfish OpenFabrics Management Framework API defines a RESTful interface and a standardized data model to provide data structures to help simplify the development of composable distributed, disaggregated, computer architectures. Sunfish contains abstract data structures that represent computer system resources, available network fabric components and management, current resource operational conditions, and abstracted representations of composed disaggregated computing systems.</p>

<h1 id="1-abstract">1. Abstract</h1>
<p>Sunfish is designed for system administrators, application programmers and users, HPC and cloud architecture designers, and other stakeholders that are involved in the design, deployment, and use of distributed computing systems based on multiple high-speed network fabrics for disaggregating hardware components.</p>
<p>Sunfish provides a universal set of RESTful interfaces, tools and services to manage fabric attached resources, such as CPUs, accelerators, storage, and memory. Sunfish uses the DMTF Redfish Scalable Platforms Management API Specification to allow clients to gather telemetry information on fabrics and components, request information about fabric attachments, allocate components, and compose disaggregated systems. Each vendor specific fabric can be controlled and manipulated through the use of a custom agent that is designed to provide its services and functions to Sunfish via the Redfish API. Sunfish is designed to be versatile and allow clients to connect and interact with underlying high-speed fabrics.</p>
<p>Sunfish provides computing system clients with a common set of tools, to interact with disaggregated fabrics and resources. Clients may include, but are not limited to, Message Passing Interface applications, Fabric Attached Memory (FAM), workload, resource, and cloud managers, IO systems, storage configuration managers, and CPU and accelerator resources. Client embodiments may include, but are not limited to, physical machines, virtual machines, appliances, embedded computational engines, and containers. Any entity (e.g., SW tool, admin GUI, shell script via CLI) may create a virtual platform, pod, cluster, partition, vLan, job queue, or subnet to enable some workload(s) to execute.</p>
<h1 id="2-document-scope">2. Document Scope</h1>
<h2 id="21-audience-assumptions">2.1. Audience Assumptions</h2>
<p>As Sunfish is designed as an extension of the Redfish Scalable Platforms Management API Specification, this document is written with the presumption that the reader has a detailed understanding of the Redfish Specification. This document cannot be fully understood without that context.</p>

<h2 id="31-introduction">3.1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Sunfish is a centralized management platform for Composable Disaggregated Infrastructure (CDI).  Sunfish provides a method by which compute resources, that are attached by high speed, low latency networks (e.g., CXL/PCIe, RDMA, Ethernet), can be assembled together and managed as if the components were part of a traditional compute server.</p>
<p>This chapter provides a description of Sunfish and attached components that provide organized assembly of material resources and managers that provide the hardware associations used in composing systems out of disaggregated components.</p>
<h3 id="311-overview-of-composable-disaggregated-infrastructure">3.1.1. Overview of Composable Disaggregated Infrastructure</h3>
<p>With Composable Disaggregated Infrastructures (CDI), computational resources are not statically provisioned in servers, but instead are physically disaggregated in shared pools and connected through high-speed/low-latency network fabrics. These resources may be dynamically provisioned and re-provisioned to client applications, as needed, and are thus not only more efficient to manage by removing unnecessary hardware, but help reduce energy consumption and datacenter cooling costs.  CDI enables assigning of pools of resources to consumers.  Remote resource disaggregation is already common for storage devices (e.g., NVMe-oF); current trends are pushing this paradigm further, extending it to assigning private or shared resources such as computational engines, disaggregated memory elements, disaggregated accelerators, and eventually to all forms of compute resources required by modern HPC applications.</p>
<p>CDI eases issues currently plaguing today's HPC, Cloud, AI, etc. architectures.  In current large-scale compute architectures, clusters are created by combining separate servers over shared network fabrics. Traditional compute servers in clusters are statically provisioned and assembled with their own CPUs, memory devices, accelerator cards, and storage devices contained within a fixed size server enclosure. The need to incorporate “all of the options that may be required to support a given workload” often results in resource over-provisioning, limits parallel workloads, makes traditional HPC architectures less flexible and less efficient, and can lead to situations where application jobs are more prone to run-time failure. Resource over-provisioning and inefficient use of hardware are common issues to any large scale computing facility.</p>
<h3 id="312-managing-composable-disaggregated-infrastructure">3.1.2. Managing Composable Disaggregated Infrastructure</h3>
<p>The management and optimization of such a diverse set of fabrics and fabric technologies to realize the benefits of Composable Disaggregated Infrastructures is quickly becoming a complex issue to solve for infrastructure managers, especially in heterogeneous multi-vendor environments, with multiple vendor-sourced hardware and the ever-expanding collection of proprietary APIs and tools.</p>
<p>The larger the HPC or Cloud system, the greater the potential impact of dynamic CDI to improve both energy efficiency and computational stability. Composability Managers are needed to efficiently connect workloads with resources in a dynamic ecosystem, at scale, without concern for the management model of the underlying hardware technology. Centralized composability management must be scalable to be able to handle massive amounts of hardware telemetry, device states, device capabilities, and subscription information from large numbers of resources.</p>
<p>Using centrally managed CDI on large-scale resources can lead to more efficient distribution of the resources, increased batch run performance, and allow measurable performance where efficient resource scheduling is as important as physical size.  As such, integration of newer HPC Workload Managers and Container deployment systems should be part of a master plan for centralized CDI management.  With aggregation of resources to meet parallel batch run requirements, CDI aggregation of resources should be made only after full verification that those aggregations can be made successfully.</p>
<h3 id="313-sunfishcdi-value-propositions">3.1.3. Sunfish/CDI Value Propositions</h3>
<p>Sunfish and its components provide scalable central CDI management for large-scale, heterogeneous computing systems.  The core component of Sunfish, the database acts as the 'source of truth' for both aggregation and resource attachment for the current state of the running system.  Connected Agents provide real-time interaction with hardware and network management components and are tasked with providing 'real world' hardware configuration and provisioning.  A Composability Manager allows for complex integration with both workload and container deployments.  The Composability Manager is designed to heuristically integrate with client Workload and Container deployment systems. The Composability Manager attempts to associate client workloads with requested resource components.</p>
<h4 id="3132--more-efficient-sharing-of-resources-through-resource-pools">3.1.3.2  More Efficient Sharing of Resources Through Resource Pools</h4>
<p>In current HPC systems, hardware resources that are necessary to provide every type of computation must be installed into the compute nodes. Batch job execution, whether through a Workload Manager (e.g., Flux) or through container deployment (e.g., Kubernetes), is generally done through priorities and back-fill.  Each batch job occupies an allocation of a fixed grouping of resources.  This type of architectural system design leads to both stranded and wasted resources and limitations on the resources may be available to other user jobs. For instance, if a user job requires six GPUs, 1 TB of on-board memory, and eight CPU cores in each node to complete a batch job, then the job cannot be run on a cluster with four GPUs and four CPU cores. In addition, if a batch job needs two GPUs and two CPU cores, two GPUs and two CPU cores are wasted resources that can't be allocated to other 'needy' batch jobs. A Workload Manager or a container deployment system may be considered to be Workload Deployment Engine 'Client Batch Requestors' (CBRs). Through heuristic integration with CBRs, more efficient time-based software-defined compute nodes may be deployed with the best available resource associations, leading to higher overall batch throughput and lower cost of operation. &lt;TODO: Better description of CBR is required&gt;</p>
<p>Heuristic integration of CBRs with Sunfish CDI management through a Composability Manager allows Sunfish to scale to the actual physical hardware size of a target system. The Sunfish Composability Management framework provides a queued stateful method of handling and verifying client requests from the CBRs to provide a locking mechanism to prevent collisions from conflicting composition requests and ensure that efficient and stable configurations of composed systems are capable of being made.</p>
<p>In the event that the requested and pre-scheduled configuration is not achievable or because of hardware failure, the entire request fails, the current resource allocation state of the machine is maintained, and a notification is sent to the CBRs. In the event that the allocation is unable to be performed, the CBRs can then remake an overall allocation of VNs request.</p>
<h4 id="3133-sharing-of-memory-resources">3.1.3.3. Sharing of Memory resources</h4>
<p>The CXL 3.1 specification enables remote memory to be pooled or shared. Figure <TBD insert figure reference> shows a simple example of memory sharing. On the left side, the orange node is connected to the orange NVMe memory through a CXL switch. On the right side, the CXL components have been configured to allow the orange node to take a smaller portion of a shared NVMe memory. The blue node, needing more memory resources, has a portion of the shared memory and another CXL memory, again connected via a CXL fabric switch. Each of these CXL devices and switches potentially have their own hardware manager entities, each of which must be informed of the required configuration details. The Sunfish Framework provides administrators a single API through which to manage all these different components.</p>
<p>&lt;TODO: Figure out which figure is it that belongs here&gt;
<img src="file:////Users/christian/workspace/Sunfish/sunfish_docs/C:%5CUsers%5Cpccayton%5CAppData%5CRoaming%5CTypora%5Ctypora-user-images%5Cimage-20231222105329458.png" alt="image-20231222105329458"></p>
<h4 id="3134-sharing-of-storage-resources">3.1.3.4. Sharing of Storage Resources</h4>
<p>&lt;TODO: Phil redo this section&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;TBD: Note/opinion - the material in this section is interesting, however it is not a general discussion of sharing scale-out remote storage resources and is oddly specific - not sure what to do here - requires discussion&gt;</p>
<p>Node-local parallel filesystems (e.g., BeeGFS, Lustre) provide ephemeral scratch space to keep inter-node IO traffic localized. In many cases, the best way to implement the back-end block devices for these node-local parallel filesystems is with RAM disks. On-demand parallel filesystems are implemented with management, metadata targets and object storage (&lt;TBD - insert reference to figure&gt;). The amount of allocated RAM disk storage must provide enough space to accommodate growth of metadata and object storage stripes. Communication between the parallel filesystem components can be performed via Ethernet but is more commonly performed with RDMA to reduce communication latency and improve bandwidth. In current HPC and Cloud architectures, using RAM disk block devices consumes compute nodes's RAM and reduces the amount of memory available to running processes.</p>
<p>In a composable parallel computing system, a better option is to deploy requested RAM disk storage from available NVMe memory blocks, using Machine Learning trained datasets to find the memory that is going to provide the highest IO transaction bandwidth and lowest latency. As shown in the figure, CPU cores are matched to NVMe memories through CXL-3.1 spec peer-to-peer network switches. Included in the diagram, are block storage devices that are available through the CXL switches for another option. IO block transactions are very good candidates for dynamically attached memories blocks, because processes and threads can be placed into an IO wait queue by the OS until the transactions are completed and an interrupt is generated. Again, each of these CXL devices and switches potentially have their own hardware manager entities, each of which must be informed of the required configuration details. The Sunfish Framework provides administrators a single API through which to manage all these different components.</p>

<h4 id="3135-composable-accelerators">3.1.3.5 Composable Accelerators</h4>
<p>The cost of acquiring, maintaining, sharing, and cooling computational accelerators has begun to be an issue for large-scale parallel systems, such as HPC and Cloud computing platforms. CDI, through the use of fabrics and CXL can help provide accelerator resources, peer-to-peer, where they are needed in batch computations.</p>
<p>As an example, GPUs can be managed by Sunfish as part of network fabric attached pools, or through CXL switches as part of a heuristically assigned and timed, peer-to-peer resource sharing architectural arrangement, across compute nodes. The Sunfish Core database provides entry links that reflect the current attachment arrangement. The Sunfish Composability Manager state graph database, allows the CBRs to explore dynamic associations and constructions while a pre-testing graph database allows the CBRs to explore the potential associations and aggregations that are possible from within the current cluster state.</p>
<h2 id="32-sunfish-framework-scope">3.2. Sunfish Framework Scope</h2>
<h3 id="321-goal">3.2.1. Goal</h3>
<p>Provide clients of Sunfish with a vendor and fabric agnostic API which enables them to view manage and orchestrate the resources in a CDI scenario. Users will be able to query all the resources in the available fabrics, understand their status, manipulate their state and finally compose them into virtualized compute nodes that can then be assigned to workloads directly or via virtual machines and containers.</p>
<h3 id="322-strategy">3.2.2. Strategy</h3>
<p>Standardize on models of composable fabric resources based on the DMTF Redfish and SNIA Swordfish schema.</p>
<p>Analyze specific tasks which applications and administrators need to perform to access and/or manage composable fabric resources (and ‘fabric management objects’) at an appropriate level of abstraction. Specific tasks are use cases (e.g., creating shared regions of FAM, binding/mapping shared regions of fabric attached memory to specific CPUs (hosts), placing specific fabric resources under control of specific orchestration tools, etc).</p>
<p>Extract a suitable model of such abstracted resource objects and functional operations, and define the necessary Actors and their roles in the message and work flows (APIs) that accomplish the specific tasks.</p>
<h3 id="323-deliverables-in-this-document">3.2.3. Deliverables in This Document</h3>
<p>This document describes the approach and architecture of the sunfish framework, its software  and the API that actors use for interacting with a Sunfish service.
This document is also defining the <em>Sunfish compliant</em> interpretation of Redfish and Swordfish schemas. All APIs and interactions are based on DMTF Redfish and SNIA Swordfish specifications. New schema objects are introduced and detailed whenever necessary.</p>
<h1 id="4-sunfish-framework">4. Sunfish Framework</h1>
<p>Sunfish is designed to configure fabric interconnects and manage composable, disaggregated resources in dynamic highly distributed compute infrastructures using client-friendly abstractions. Sunfish provides a framework for abstraction of, and communication with, the multitude of independent management tools behind a single, consistent, standards-based API; it
does this through a universal set of RESTful interfaces and tools and services to manage fabric attached resources, such as, CPUs, Accelerators, and Memory Devices. Sunfish uses the common languages of Redfish and Swordfish, to allow clients to gather telemetry information on fabrics and components, request information about fabric attachments, allocate components, and compose disaggregated systems. Each vendor specific fabric can be controlled and manipulated through the use of a custom agent that is designed to provide its services and functions to Sunfish via the Redfish API. <a href="#sunfish-objectives-fig">Figure x</a> presents the concepts of the Sunfish Framework in visual form.</p>
<p><a id="sunfish-objectives-fig"></a></p>

<p style="text-align:center">Figure x: Sunfish framework objectives</span>
</p>
<p><a href="#sunfish-objectives-fig">Figure x</a> makes several important points:</p>
<ul>
<li>On the right we have our disaggregated resources with potentially many different management entities in direct control using vendor and device specific means.</li>
<li>We need an Agent layer (aka ‘provider’) to aggregate the inventory from one or more hardware managers and convert the hardware specific device and resource descriptions into a publicly accepted and commonly interpreted Redfish model.</li>
<li>The Agent hands this whole model over to the Sunfish services. This effectively abstracts much of the hardware specific details from the clients.</li>
<li>Clients of Sunfish services see the Redfish models of resources and manipulate these models to establish or alter the state of individual resources or their assignments (bindings) to consumers (e.g., hosts).</li>
<li>As it is critical that Agents and Clients have the same interpretation of a Redfish object found in the Sunfish database, the Sunfish framework also has policies and requirements to be followed when creating or interpreting the Redfish models.</li>
</ul>

</p>
<p>CDI requires some modest amount of scale, which in turn likely requires a Redfish representation of many different resource types residing on different interconnects, all supplied by different vendors. Disaggregated resources and interconnect fabrics may or may not support a Redfish API suitable for directly plugging into the Sunfish management framework, so the presence of an API translating Agent entity is used in all cases, though the complexity of any given Agent obviously depends upon the actual fabric management APIs and policies in use in the <em>hardware managers</em> realm. Sunfish not only collects and manages the Redfish object models for disaggregated resources and the fabrics that connects them, but also serves up control points for many common management tasks, such as Events and Logs, Access Control settings and policies, and authentication needs.</p>
<h3 id="411-clients">4.1.1. Clients</h3>
<p>Clients are any of the applications, application libraries (e.g., libfabric, OpenFAM, or OpenSHMEM), resource managers (such as FAM pool managers, storage pool managers), orchestration managers, workload managers, and the admin GUI and tools that call into the Sunfish CORE’s Redfish Services.</p>
<p>Client software queries the Sunfish core Redfish service (e.g., using HTTP GET) to determine what resources are available on the fabric. Clients issue updates (e.g., using HTTP PUT, POST, PATCH, DELETE) to objects to make modifications to the Redfish fabric model.</p>
<p>Clients identify the fabric resources by the URIs given them by the Sunfish core’s Redfish service. When clients need to exchange information about fabric resources, they use the Sunfish core’s URIs to unambiguously refer to specific objects.</p>
<p>Below an example Sunfish URI:</p>
<pre><code>/redfish/v1/Systems/1
</code></pre>
<p>Clients accept the Redfish object description as the common truth. The URIs in use within the Sunfish core Redfish service are unique only to that Service and make up that Sunfish core’s Redfish URI namespace.</p>
<h3 id="412-composability-manager-services">4.1.2. Composability Manager Services</h3>
<p>The element that sits between clients and the Sunfish core central block is collectively called the Composability Manager. The Composability Manager can be seen as a collection of resource managers, policy stores, and monitoring elements for tracking the current state of the entire system in relation to the dynamic composition of disaggregated components. The Composability Manager is in charge of composing hardware resources according to requirements coming from clients and by applying specific policies. Technically, the components of the Composability Manager are all clients of the Sunfish core services and any user or admin application can pursue taking responsibility for these tasks. However, within the Sunfish core architecture we anticipate releasing a coordinated set of reference code utilities to offer random clients commonly needed ‘composability’ features.</p>
<p>Examples of such features include, but may not be limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Composition/Deletion of computer systems and clusters</li>
<li>Dynamic update of computer systems resources</li>
<li>Application driven dynamic resources configuration and provisioning such as:
<ul>
<li>Creation and binding of memory and storage resources</li>
<li>Creation and binding of shared memory region across nodes</li>
<li>On-demand provisioning of accelerators</li>
<li>Virtual network creation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Management of client permissions/resource ownership</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Coordinating these various clients enforces a cohesive interpretation of the Redfish objects and schema which are used to describe the fabric resources being managed.</em> In addition, permissions and access controls for shared fabric resources need to be managed in this layer, which is above the Sunfish Core which enforces access controls and below the general Clients upon which the restrictions are imposed.</p>
<h3 id="413-sunfish-core-services">4.1.3. Sunfish Core Services</h3>
<p>The Sunfish core maintains the aggregate Redfish model of all fabrics it controls and all resources on those fabrics. The Sunfish core services are presented to all clients via Redfish API calls into the Sunfish core library. <!-- CP: should we mention the library in here? -->
When clients request data or request changes to model objects, the Sunfish Core determines which Redfish objects in the model are impacted, makes the required changes to those Redfish objects in the model. Any relevant actions or requests that affect state or configuration of the fabric manager or actual fabric hardware are relayed by the Sunfish core to the fabric-specific Agent.</p>
<p>The Sunfish core also subscribes to events from the various Agents and offers its own Events Subscription Service to Sunfish core clients. Clients and the Composability Manager can subscribe to the various Redfish events defined for the Redfish objects, and when the Sunfish Core receives associated events from the Agents these events are forwarded to those subscribed to receive them.</p>
<!-- CP: fabric agents / hardware agents 
we decided on Sunfish Agent
-->
<p>Not all client requests will require the Sunfish core to interact with a fabric Agent. Many requests (e.g., a request to register to receive certain events) simply affect the Sunfish Core fabric model and some bookkeeping properties therein. Some simple client requests (e.g., to DELETE an object) may translate to multiple changes to multiple model objects and potentially require multiple exchanges with the fabric Agent. Maintaining the integrity and consistency of the aggregate Redfish model of all fabric resources is one of the primary duties and major values of the Sunfish core and associated Agents.</p>
<p>Finally, the Sunfish core is responsible for tracking and enforcing Authentication and Access Control policies for both Clients and Agents.</p>
<h3 id="414-agents">4.1.4. Agents</h3>
<p>Fabric-specific agents act as the translators between the Sunfish core Redfish API syntax and schema and the vendor-specific versions used by the given hardware manager software. Agents thus expose a Redfish interface to the Sunfish core, and use a (potentially) fabric-specific protocols to an actual hardware manager. E.g., the hardware manager may have a RESTful interface called ‘bind resource’ which allows an admin to enable Host A to access Memory B. The Sunfish Core’s Redfish equivalent is ‘POST Connection’ between Host A and Memory B.</p>
<p>Fabric-specific agents also act as the translator between the Sunfish core Redfish URI namespace and the fabric specific component and resource namespaces. E.g., the open source Gen-Z fabric manager for Linux (called Zephyr) assigns its own 128-bit UUID-style ID to a Gen-Z fabric memory module. Redfish models a complicated fabric resident memory module as several related Redfish objects (Fabric Adapters, fabric Ports, fabric Endpoints, Memory Domains, etc). The Gen-Z agent is responsible for keeping the mappings between the various Redfish IDs (URIs) assigned by the Sunfish Core and the associated IDs (UUIDs) assigned by the Zephyr Fabric Manager. Clients use the Redfish IDs, and the hardware manager uses the hardware manager IDs. The agent is possibly the only entity that knows both namespaces.</p>
<p>Like the Sunfish Core, an agent needs to parse requests coming from its client (the Sunfish core), modify its internal representation of its fabric view, update any internal state it is required to track, and send any appropriate request or requests on to the appropriate fabric manager.</p>
<p>Another very important role of the agent is to aggregate the inventory and events from multiple hardware manager instances used to configure and control larger fabrics as <need reference to detailed block diagram > Figure 1 illustrates. Since a large fabric may have multiple hardware managers controlling components on the fabric which must share a common fabric address namespace, <strong>the task of reconciling multiple namespaces and ‘subnets’ into a single Redfish Fabric representation falls to the agent.</strong> Even when the hardware Managers' APIs are also Redfish, the agent is responsible for sequencing appropriate Redfish commands and/or actions to the appropriate FMs and coordinating the multiple returns into a suitable response to the Sunfish Core.</p>
<p>Finally, the agent passes events, alerts, and performance monitoring updates in support of the Sunfish CORE’s Redfish events service. The agent – hardware manager interface is hardware manager specific. The Sunfish Core – Agent interface is architected to be a Redfish API using Redfish schema, so the agent must translate events and logs emitted by or retrieved from the FM into the appropriate Redfish formats.</p>
<h4 id="4141-agents-representation-in-the-sunfish-model-">4.1.4.1. Agents Representation in the Sunfish Model <a id="agent-model"></a></h4>
<p>The Sunfish core component maintains the complete state of the system it oversees, in the form of a Redfish tree. Therefore, each object managed through Sunfish (e.g., memory, server, switch) has its own Redfish counterpart which will consist of one or more Redfish object(s).
Agents are represented in Sunfish by means of the <code>AggregationSource</code> object that in Redfish represents the source of information for the resources it <em>aggregates</em>.</p>
<p>The below snippet shows an example <em>AggregationSource</em> for a fictional CXL Fabric agent. The <code>HostName</code> field contains the endpoint for connecting to the specific agent. The language to be used for interacting with agents is specified in the <code>ConnectionMethod</code> field contained in the <code>Links</code> section of the object. There are multiple possible options for a connection method, but Sunfish will always use <strong>Redfish</strong> for connecting with its agents. In Sunfish, e keep the connection method field only for the sake of being complete with respect to the Redfish specification.</p>

<h2 id="42-hardware-managers">4.2. Hardware Managers</h2>
<p>The term 'hardware manager' refers to any hardware/software component that is direct control of a set of hardware components (e.g., hardware managers, enclosure managers, BMCs, etc.). The terms ‘fabric manager’ and ‘fabric management’ carry many different interpretations throughout the industry. Certainly, the large numbers of functions and features required to manage even a modest ‘fabric’ may require many different blocks of code to execute in many different ‘layers’ of a ‘fabric management software stack’.</p>
<!-- Russ: this needs to be reworked to make sure we describe the difference between hardware manager and the overloaded term fabric manager -->
<p>For the purposes of the Sunfish Core Architecture, hardware managers (FMs) are those entities with physical access to the control space of the fabric resources and the authority to modify those settings. A FM is responsible for performing a fabric crawl, taking inventory of fabric resources, and the initial configuration of such resources as required by the FM’s initial configuration policies. The FM’s ‘management domain’ is those components for which it has primary access rights to the associated control surfaces. ‘fabric manager’ as used herein is Gen-Z terminology, but the more popular ‘subnet manager’ term is inconsistent across various other fabrics, so we will use Fabric Manager herein.</p>
<!-- Add a sentence describing this is somethig that is on the vendor to implement -->
<h2 id="43-sunfish-framework-events-">4.3. Sunfish Framework Events <a id="events"></a></h2>
<p>Agents are resource aggregators that present Sunfish with a Redfish / Swordfish model of all resources which they manage and/or model. Sunfish-agent communications are event-driven.
Events are exchanged upon every change in the state of the overall system, be it a new component being added, a component reporting a failure, etc.
The format of the events exchanged between Sunfish and clients/agents is defined as part of the Redfish schema. Redfish defines an Event Message Registry <a href="#72-a2-informational-references">[1]</a> that dictates the format and type of all legal Redfish events.</p>
<p>Redfish events are based on the subscription model, where a Redfish API instance will generate events only towards subscribers based on the characteristic of the event to be sent, and the filters specified in the available subscriptions. Subscriptions are used by Sunfish clients to register to events of interest, as well as the Sunfish core itself to register to all events generated by all hardware agents. Subscriptions are represented as <code>EventDestination</code> Redfish objects part of the EventService exposed by the Redfish endpoint generating the events.</p>
<h2 id="44-interactions-between-sunfish-and-hardware-agents">4.4. Interactions Between Sunfish and Hardware Agents</h2>
<h3 id="441-hardware-agent-registration">4.4.1. Hardware Agent Registration</h3>
<p>Each hardware agent must first register with the Sunfish core service before its resources can be integrated and managed from the Sunfish main endpoint. The registration and discovery of agents is performed through a handshake triggered, usually, at agent startup. All the interactions part of the discovery handshake are based on Redfish events (<a href="#events">Section 4.2</a>). The handshake process is depicted in <a href="#handshake-fig">Figure x</a>. As explained in <a href="#events">Section 4.2</a>, events in Redfish are based on the subscription model, where an <code>EventDestination</code> object exists for each subscribed entity. Each Sunfish agent exposes an Event Service with a single subscription pre-created for the Sunfish core Event Service. In this way any event generated by the agent is always sent to Sunfish. The Sunfish specification does not prevent other actors from subscribing to agent events. An <code>EventDestination</code> should be populated preferably prior to the agent startup, and necessarily before an event is emitted by the agent. The information contained in such object are the URI and port for reaching the Sunfish Event Service as well information for encryption of messages (i.e., certificates).</p>

<p>The handshake process is depicted in <a href="#handshake-fig">Figure x</a>. The registration process starts (1) with the agent sending an <code>AggregationSourceDiscovered</code> event to the Sunfish <em>EventListener</em> service. Such event carries the connection method type, <em>Redfish</em> for any Sunfish applications, and the service endpoint in the format <code>hostname:port</code>. Information is passed through events by mean of the <code>MessageArgs</code> field with their format being mandated by the Redfish Message Registry<a href="#72-a2-informational-references">[1]</a>. An example event is shown in the below snippet.</p>

<p>Once Sunfish receives the event, it will (2) generate a 128-bit UUID associated to the registering agent and create an <code>AggregationSource</code> as described in <a href="#agent-model">Section 4.1.4.1</a>. Once the registration is completed, the Sunfish core is sending the UUID back to the agent by patching (3) the <code>Context</code> field in the event subscription that the agent has pre-populated with the Sunfish core connection details.</p>
<p>Once the agent is registered, it will send one or more events to advertise those resources that are to be managed through Sunfish. After the registration is successful, any further event sent by an agent will contain the UUID of the registered agent in the <code>Context</code> field of the event payload. Each agent can retrieve the UUID from the <code>Context</code> field in the EventDestination that keeps the information for sending events to the Sunfish core.
For each resource to be advertised, a <code>ResourceCreated</code> event is sent containing the new resource in the <code>OriginOfCondition</code> field (reference figure <TBD>). For each of these events received, Sunfish will crawl the tree that has the resource as root, and add all the resources in its own global view of the system. While crawling, for each further resource to be visited, a GET operation is issued to the agent to get all the details on the resource itself. Once added to the tree, the resource is also added to the <code>ResourcesAccessed</code> field in the <code>Links</code> section of the <code>AggregationSource</code> object associated to the agent.</p>

<p>As a result of the crawling process all resources part of the sub-tree of the advertised resources are brought into the Sunfish tree. At the same time, all resources discovered through links are also added to the Sunfish tree, even if they do not directly belong to the sub-tree of the advertised resource.</p>
<h3 id="442-forwarding-requests-to-hardware-agents">4.4.2. Forwarding Requests to Hardware Agents</h3>
<p>To facilitate associating a resource in the Sunfish Redfish tree with the managing agent, all resources are marked during the crawling process (<a href="#431-hardware-agent-registration">Section 4.3.1</a>) with the agent UUID.
Objects are marked using the <code>Oem</code> field that, according to the Redfish specification, can be used by organizations for adding custom fields to Redfish objects. The below snippet shows the structure of the Sunfish Oem extensions used for marking objects. The <code>ManagingAgent</code> field contains the full Sunfish URI of the managing agent <code>AggregationSource</code>. This structure helps the Sunfish internal services to quickly associate an agent to an object while performing operations on the Redfish tree. An example is a fabric connection being created. In order for the actual connection to take place, the request should be forwarded to the agent managing the specific fabric. The URI contained in the Oem extension field of the Fabric object would identify the managing agent, without the need for looking up across all the available agents.</p>

<h2 id="45-failover--failure-recovery">4.5. Failover / Failure-recovery</h2>
<p>The following scenarios are example failure and restart situations that the Sunfish architecture is intended to cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Agent Restart: A running fabric has an up-to-date Sunfish Core Services model of the fabric, provided by a specific instance of an Agent which, in turn, is in communication with one or more running hardware managers. Then the Agent software instance encounters a fault and restarts. The Sunfish Core Services' Client APIs and services may be momentarily stalled, but are not terminated. The fabric hardware managers remain functional with no service interruptions to completely configured virtual platforms. Agent services are unavailable until the reboot completes and the Agent software rebuilds its state and internal fabric models from the hardware managers' state and the alerts Sunfish Core that it must re-load the fabric model in case anything changed on the hardware while the Agent was offline.</li>
<li>Agent Failover: The same behavior applies to the Sunfish Core Services and the fabric hardware functionality, but when the Agent software instance encounters a fault it shuts down rather than reboots. A secondary (failover) Agent detects the failure of the primary Agent, securely terminates the primary Agent and assumes the role of the primary Agent in a fashion similar to the Agent Restart scenario.</li>
<li>Hardware manager restart or failover: A running fabric has an up-to-date Sunfish Core Services model of the fabric, provided by a specific instance of an Agent which, in turn, is in communication with one or more running hardware managers. If any of the hardware managers encounters a fault or otherwise determines that its internal state may be inconsistent with the hardware, the hardware manager restarts or failovers to a secondary hardware manager without disturbing the current state of the fabric hardware.</li>
</ul>
<p>The primary axioms in all the above scenarios are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Any restart of the software above the fabric hardware <strong>shall not</strong> disturb the current state of the fabric hardware in the process of rebuilding software's state.</li>
<li>The current state of the fabric hardware is the one source of truth for fabric hardware state. All hardware managers, Agents, and the Sunfish Core <strong>shall</strong> rebuild their internal models to be consistent with the current fabric hardware state.</li>
<li>Sunfish Core Service restarts or failovers require that the Sunfish Core Service <strong>shall have</strong> a mechanism to 're-discover' all the Agents that are currently still running. The Sunfish Framework defines how this is <em>done in the section on Sunfish Core and Agent communications.</em></li>
</ol>
<!-- CP: we do not have this yet -->
<ol start="4">
<li>Sunfish Agents likewise <strong>shall have</strong> a mechanism to re-discover any existing hardware managers running.</li>
</ol>
<p>To discern whether the current state of a Core Service, an Agent instance or a hardware manager is consistent with current running hardware the Sunfish Framework proposes some basic requirements for hardware managers and Agents to supply the equivalent of UUIDs to the Sunfish Framework for certain basic</p>
<ul>
<li>Hardware managers that feed the Agent the inventory and status of the fabric components they are managing <strong>shall</strong> apply some form of hardware manager created UUID that identify the hardware manager instance that created the inventory. The Agent <strong>shall</strong> include a form of that UUID in a Fabric ID that the Agent supplies when it registers with Sunfish Core and sends the aggregated Redfish model for the resources reported by the Agent. This ties a Sunfish fabric model to a set of specific instances of hardware managers managing the associated hardware.</li>
<li>Each individual resource reported by the hardware manager to the Agent <strong>shall</strong> have a unique UUID that is fixed to the hardware components.</li>
<li>An Agent that restarts can retrieve the current state of the hardware managers' resources. If the hardware managers have not reset, each will return the same hardware manager instance UUID to the restarted Agent. When the Agent re-uses those same UUIDs to generate a Fabric ID, it <strong>shall</strong> register with the same Fabric ID as last time.</li>
<li>When the restarted Agent attempts to register the same Fabric ID and an inventory that contains (mostly) already present hardware UUIDs, this is a major tip-off to Sunfish Core that this 'new Agent' is managing an existing fabric and not a totally new version.</li>
<li>If it had been the hardware managers that restarted and not the Agent, the hardware manager instance UUID will change and the Agent can detect the mismatch when the hardware manager registers with the Agent. Since the Agent already has an inventory containing most or all of the same hardware UUIDs, the Agent can map the new hardware manager UUID to the original hardware manager UUID that the Agent and Sunfish Core are going to continue to use as a handle for communications involving these resources.</li>
<li>When the hardware manager restarts, it <strong>shall</strong> re-discover the fabric components in its management domain. It is pretty obvious if the hardware manager is crawling out a running fabric (components in 'managed' states) vs a cold fabric (un-managed components). The hardware manager <strong>shall</strong> alert the Agent that it is reporting a 'cold start' fabric inventory.</li>
<li>The Agent and/or Sunfish Core <strong>shall</strong> have checks in their hardware manager and Agent registration process (respectively) to detect an upload of an existing fabric inventory and status, and handle both scenarios unambiguously.</li>
<li>If the hardware of the fabric was not reset, the hardware manager and the Agent <strong>shall</strong> transfer the current fabric inventory and state to Sunfish Core, preferably as a series of ResourceUpdated Events that eventually bring the resource models and inventory for all three entities (Sunfish Core, Agent, hardware manager) into alignment with the hardware truth. Sunfish Core shall issue the appropriate update Events to all correspondingly registered clients.</li>
</ul>
<p>It becomes necessary for the restarting or newly attaching hardware manager or Agent to locate that next entity in the Sunfish Framework, re-register with it, and notify it of new or possibly updated inventory and state is available. The Agent or Sunfish Core Service is responsible for detecting the possible scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>New hardware manager reporting existing inventory (e.g., hardware manager restart)</li>
<li>Old hardware manager reporting inventory change (e.g., rebooted hardware)</li>
<li>New Agent reporting existing inventory (e.g., Agent restart)</li>
</ul>
<p>The basic process is the same for any of the detected restarts or fail overs: Sunfish Core eventually learns of new or updated inventory and re-fetches the entire fabric inventory. However, Sunfish Core Services <strong>shall</strong> cross reference the UUIDs of all fetched Redfish objects with all UUIDs of the existing Sunfish Core Redfish tree looking for duplicate UUIDs with different Redfish URIs and resolve the disconnects.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when hardware managers restart or failover they may not have access to state that is created by the Sunfish Core or the Agents. Not all Redfish models of 'logical' resources are forwarded to the hardware managers, even if the hardware managers support a Redfish API for their Agents / Clients to use. If hardware manager state about these 'logical' resources is lost when the hardware manager restarts or fails over, the hardware itself may not have these details in a recognized format when hardware state is uploaded again by the hardware manager. The hardware state is the end result of a sequence of configuration requests, and the intents of the individual requests may be lost. E.g., the hardware manager can read the routing tables of a fabric switch and can determine which fabric paths exist between which physical ports on the fabric. However, the hardware manager cannot reconstruct the possibly many Redfish Zone objects that were POSTed by the Sunfish Core Services that led to these particular switch routing table contents.</p>
<p>The preceding problem also applies to Agents that restart or fail over; Agents may also be missing models of 'logical' resources created by the Core Service that are not present in the fresh inventory the Agent obtains from the hardware manager.</p>
<p>Reloading the hardware state to the Sunfish Core Services will give Sunfish Core, the Agent(s), and the hardware manager(s) the same consistent view of the hardware state. Then, Sunfish Core Services <strong>shall</strong> determine the set of Redfish objects not present in the uploaded inventory that are 'logical' resources that were defined above the hardware manager(s) and/or Agents. Sunfish Core Services <strong>shall</strong> then POST or Patch the Agents' Redfish models to make them consistent with the 'logical' view of the fabric hardware. To properly rebuild the model of the fabric across all three entities that are tracking it (Core Services, Agent and hardware manager) requires information flow in both directions along the Sunfish Framework. Obviously, if more than one entity fails, there may be no way to recover all the details properly.</p>
<p>If Sunfish Core Services restarts, there may be considerable Client supplied Redfish objects that are not recoverable from the Agent(s). However, state from within the Agent will be sufficient to restart Sunfish Core Services with an accurate view of the current fabric state. Some Client supplied Redfish objects have to be recovered from the Clients themselves.</p>

<h2 id="47-sunfish-interpretation-of-the-redfish-fabric-model">4.7. Sunfish Interpretation of the Redfish Fabric Model</h2>
<p>The following diagram depicts a simplified Redfish model of a CXL fabric that has two switch hops between a host CPU and a Fabric Attached Memory (FAM) controller.</p>
<p><img src="file:////Users/christian/workspace/Sunfish/sunfish_docs/imgs%5CRedfish_2Switch_topo.PNG" alt="Redfish_2Switch_topo"></p>
<p>The fabric itself (i.e., the physical connectivity) is modelled as <strong>Ports</strong> and <strong>Endpoints</strong>. Physical fabric connections (e.g., cables) are always shown as between 'Ports'. Ports are traced back to the fabric devices that drive the ports. Fabric devices trace back to physical or logical infrastructure which controls the fabric device and to the 'Endpoint' object associated with the fabric device. In the diagram above, the physical fabric links have been highlighted as red dotted links.</p>
<p>The host is modeled as a CXL compute <strong>System</strong> with a <strong>CPU</strong> that has a CXL port linked to the fabric <strong>Switch</strong> CXL1. The FAM controller is modeled as a <strong>Fabric Adapter</strong> that has a CXL port connected to the fabric at Switch CXL2. The host is an Endpoint on the fabric, as is the Fabric Adapter. The model above shows the two Switches have associated Endpoints, but that is often not the case. Switches are only modeled as Endpoints on the fabric if they source or sink fabric traffic. Most switches will only source and sink management plane traffic and not data plane traffic so they often have no Endpoints associated because the Redfish model is of the data plane.</p>
<p>An Endpoint can be viewed as a destination, such as a server connected by a network card or a switch port. A resource can be considered as a component such as a FAM memory controller that provides services or resources to a fabric. The physical topology dictates which resources (Endpoints) have a physical path over which they might communicate. The definition of a <em>switched</em> fabric implies all Endpoints of the fabric have physical paths over which they might communicate. There usually is a way to limit which Endpoints may communicate with which other Endpoints. The actual mechanism used is fabric-specific, as in vLans on Ethernet. In Redfish fabrics, which physical paths are enabled between two Endpoints is specified by listing those Endpoints in a <strong>Zone.</strong></p>
<p>A Zone can be viewed as a set of Endpoints that are allowed to pass traffic among the Zone members, such as the compute nodes and FAM nodes of a compute cluster. Zone descriptions can be used to determine the switches' route table contents to enable traffic between Zone members. A <strong>zone-of-zones</strong> can be considered to be a collection or union of Zones.</p>
<p>The following diagram has removed the physical link details to focus on the modelling of the more logical resources such as compute resources, FAM resources, and logical paths and connections between them. This diagram shows only one host system, and one FAM module as Endpoints (I3 and T2, respectively) on the CXL fabric. Endpoints are Initiators or Targets of traffic; the Switches are not shown as they only relay traffic and are not visible in the data plane.</p>
<p>![Redfish_FAM_ Model](imgs\Redfish_FAM_ Model.PNG)</p>
<p>Redfish models all fabric attached memory devices as a Fabric Adapter that moves traffic to or from the physical port attached to the fabric and transitions such traffic to accesses of memory resources 'behind' the Fabric Adapter.</p>
<p>The Fabric Adapter object is linked to the <strong>Memory</strong> sources that supply the actual memory media. The Memory sources are linked to the Redfish <strong>Memory Domain</strong> (memory pools) from which blocks of accessible memory capacity are allocated as <strong>Memory Chunks</strong>. We have already stated that for the host associated with Endpoint I3 to have a physical path through the fabric to the FAM module Endpoint T2, a Redfish Zone 1 must contain both Endpoints. However, Zones do not provide fine grained permissions for subsets of the resources within an Endpoint, as would be necessary for managing multi-tenant Endpoints. If Fabric Adapter 2 in the above figure had more than one Memory Chunk mapped to the fabric, the Redfish Zone does not contain a limitation of which Memory Chunks a given Initiator Endpoint in the Zone may access.</p>
<p>Thus Redfish declares that a <strong>Connection</strong> specifically enables one Endpoint entity to access some or all resources presented to the fabric by another Endpoint. E.g., a specific Memory Chunk which represents only a small portion of the total memory available behind the T2 Endpoint may be named in a Connection between two Endpoints. If the host and the FAM controller are in the same Zone the fabric will route any request from the host Endpoint to the FAM Endpoint. However, if the host’s request is not targeted to the Memory Chunk named in the Connection, the FAM controller is supposed to reject the request.</p>
<p>Discovery of physical and logical resources accessible via the fabric is necessarily a fabric-specific operation. Fabric-specific requirements for the creation and interpretation of Redfish fabric objects are listed in Appendix TBD.</p>

<p>TBD: Recap of Sunfish Agents as Fabric/Technology Specific Agents and how they map to management capabilities, APIs, ...</p>
<h2 id="51-common-roles-responsibilities-and-requirements">5.1. Common Roles, Responsibilities and Requirements</h2>
<p>The general nature of Agent duties are explained in the overview of Agents. The following is a partial list of key responsibilities of the fabric Agent Service vs the Sunfish Core Service.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Agent is responsible for locating the Sunfish CORE’s Event Service and issuing a form of New Fabric Event Notification to initiate Sunfish Core and Agent communications.</li>
<li>The Agent is responsible for declaring the Redfish IDs of all fabric physical components because the Agent presents these objects to the Sunfish CORE. The Namespace translation between the Sunfish CORE’s Redfish namespace and the Fabric Manager’s (potentially) proprietary namespace is managed by the Agent.</li>
<li>Logical objects created by allocating or binding resources of the physical components are given their Redfish IDs by the Service that defines them. E.g., when Clients of the Sunfish Core Service choose to POST a MemoryChunk, the Client decides what Redfish ID to use in the POST request. If the hardware manager had pre-configured Memory Chunks bound to specific hosts on the fabric, the Agent will assign their Redfish IDs before it makes them known to the Sunfish Core Service.</li>
<li>The Agent is responsible to aggregate multiple hardware manager inventories into one fabric namespace since Gen-z fabrics have a flat fabric address space that must be disambiguated before the fabric can carry general data traffic. Doing this aggregation makes the Agent responsible for creating a unique Redfish ID for each unique fabric component in the aggregated fabric.</li>
<li>The Agent shall provide an HTTP Redfish API to the Sunfish CORE</li>
<li>The Agent shall track the status of the Sunfish Core representation of the fabric in its Agent–specific internal fabric database for all the fabric objects that it has presented to the Sunfish Core Service, and for all the logical fabric objects sent to it by the Sunfish Core Service.
<ul>
<li>The Sunfish Core can use GETs to the Agent’s API Service to get caught up if the Sunfish Core drops</li>
<li>The Agent cannot use GETs to the Sunfish Core Service to discover what was made visible to the Sunfish Core should the Agent drop. The Agent must alert the Sunfish Core that they are potentially out of sync. The Sunfish Core must re-fetch the Agent's inventory and state and resolve any discrepancies between the new uploaded data and that data the Sunfish Core database has associated with the Agent.</li>
<li>By definition, the most recently uploaded data from the Agent, if newer (by timestamp) than what the Sunfish Core has stored is to be accepted as the latest statement of fabric state and the Sunfish Core shall amend its models to match the Agent's. See section TBD on hardware manager/Agent/Sunfish Core restart policies for more details.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Agent shall issue an Agent Restart Event to the Sunfish Core Service if the Agent drops and recovers. <em>(Actual name of event TBD)</em>
<ul>
<li>Sunfish Core and Agent actions in response to an Agent Restart are TBD. See section TBD on hardware manager/Agent/Sunfish Core restart policies for more details.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Agent parses Redfish requests from the Sunfish Core and
<ul>
<li>Evaluates the impact on the Agent’s model of the fabric</li>
<li>Evaluates the impact on the hardware manager’s state of the fabric, and creates an appropriate hardware manager specific request to cause the hardware manager to update the state of the fabric accordingly</li>
<li>Returns success or failure of the Sunfish Core request along with an appropriate Redfish object that results from a successful request</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Agent parses any Agent specific HTTP Requests. These are requests made through the Agent’s client interface that target Agent internal configuration and are not meant to directly manipulate Redfish objects. Think of these as Agent administration requests.
<ul>
<li>Examples: Restart the Agent, sync with a Redundant Agent</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Agent registers for events from the hardware manager to receive notice of dynamic changes in fabric hardware and hardware manager or Host software.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="711-important-taxonomy-used-within-the-context-of-discussions-around-fam">7.1.1. Important taxonomy used within the context of discussions around FAM</h3>
<p><strong>Producer, Memory source, Memory resource, Memory target, Memory funder:</strong> The physical entity attached to the fabric that supplies memory resources to satisfy fabric requests for memory reads and writes. This physical entity will store or recall the data being written or read.</p>
<p><strong>Consumer, Host, Compute Entity, Data Mover, Requester, Initiator:</strong> The physical entity attached to the fabric that launches a fabric request for a memory read or write transaction to the target device. This physical entity will source or sink the data contained in the fabric memory read or write transaction.</p>
<p><strong>Homogeneous memory resource capacity:</strong> The first requirement for FAM capacity to be considered homogeneous is such Memory capacity shall have the same persistence or volatile property across the entire range of data locations serviced by said memory sources. A secondary consideration is not a requirement, but a strong recommendation. Homogeneous memory capacity should have a similar access latency from similar access points such that multiple threads accessing the same addresses within the capacity have consistent performance.</p>
<p><strong>Fabric Attached Memory (FAM)</strong> is memory capacity that can be accessed across the fabric where:</p>
<ul>
<li>The source of FAM is the Producer and the target of memory requests.</li>
<li>The Consumer is the initiator of a memory request and the Consumer of memory (e.g., a Host or a data move engine).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Regions vs MemoryRegions:</strong> <em>Regions</em> are sub-sets of memory media capacity in the Redfish schema for <em>Memory</em>. The CXL spec defines something completely different called a <em>Dynamic Capacity Memory Region</em> (DC Region for short) that Redfish has named a <strong>MemoryRegion</strong>. The <em>MemoryRegion</em> object is a subordinate of the CXL Logical Device object and therefore currently a CXL-specific object. <em>Regions</em> is a property within the <em>Memory</em> object.</p>

<p>The Redfish bubble diagram in the above figure depicts the Redfish object hierarchy of a FAM object as described by the above Fabric Adapter, Memory Domains, Memory sources, and an existing Memory Chunk. See Section 4.5. for details. Note that requirement that the Memory Domains of a FAM device be homogeneous, coupled with the definition that a Memory Chunk is a subordinate of a single Memory Domain implicitly defines a Memory Chunk to consist of homogeneous media locations from within one physical device.</p>
<h3 id="712-sunfish-requirements-for-redfish-models-of-fam">7.1.2. Sunfish Requirements for Redfish Models of FAM</h3>
<p>All fabric Agents are expected to comply with the following Sunfish interpretations and requirements when creating Redfish models of a FAM resource on any fabric. The following discussion introduces the critical Redfish objects that are intended to model FAM resources, and declares several general required policies that fabric Agents shall follow when creating these objects. FAM is memory capacity that can be accessed across a fabric.</p>
<p>To have a presence on a fabric, <strong>the FAM Producer shall have at least one Endpoint on the fabric</strong>. <strong>A physical Endpoint shall have an associated unique fabric address that appears in the fabric transport-layer packets.</strong> This unique fabric address does not have to be visible in the Redfish Endpoint object JSON description. However, the <strong>Agent / hardware manager stack shall have the ability to translate a Redfish request targeted to a unique Redfish Endpoint object into one or more fabric-specific requests targeted at the unique fabric hardware entities.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An Endpoint presenting physical FAM to the fabric shall have a Connected Entity link to a single Fabric Adapter</strong>. The Fabric Adapter represents the physical device that fields the fabric memory requests from the fabric and produces the response packets to return to the requester. A Fabric Adapter may have multiple ports which link into the fabric. Different fabrics may have different associations of these multiple ports to fabric IDs. A single Fabric Adapter may present more than one Endpoint on the fabric, but <strong>any given physical Endpoint object shall not have more than one associated Fabric Adapter</strong>. <strong>If a physical device presents multiple physical devices to the fabric through a single fabric Port, each physical device shall have its own Redfish Endpoint.</strong> A Fabric Adapter may present multiple logical devices to the fabric as multiple logical Endpoints. <strong>Each logical device shall be modelled as one and only one logical Endpoint</strong>.</p>
<p>The Fabric Adapter device may or may not make known to the hardware manager any details about its associated chassis / enclosure, FRU, containing assembly, or other managers of such related entities. If the hardware manager cannot discern a specific Chassis object housing the FAM’s Fabric Adapter, <strong>the hardware manager/Agent stack shall create a generic FAM Chassis instance and attach the Fabric Adapter to the FAM Chassis’ subordinate Fabric Adapters collection.</strong> If the Fabric Adapter’s chassis details are supplied to Sunfish by a different Agent (e.g., the chassis manager’s Agent), the only clear indicator that the generic FAM Chassis instance created by the fabric Agent and the chassis described by the chassis manager’s Agent are one and the same chassis is for both Agents to fill in the same Redfish Object UUID (or its equivalent) for the Fabric Adapter they each modeled. <strong>Therefore, all fabric component instances shall posses a globally unique, vendor defined UUID or equivalent that can be read by each manager that may become involved.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The hardware manager shall create the subordinate PORTS collection and instantiate an appropriate Fabric Adapter Port object for each physical PORT discovered on the Fabric Adapter.</strong> The Fabric Adapter, by definition must have at least one physical port connected to the fabric which claims this Endpoint. The Fabric Adapter may have additional PORTs that are connected to devices not currently modelled as Redfish Switches or Redfish Endpoints on this same fabric.</p>
<p><strong>The hardware manager shall discover the entirety of the FAM resources accessible through the Fabric Adapter, and shall create appropriate homogeneous Redfish Memory resource objects to describe the available memory capacity.</strong> When the hardware manager discovers the FAM device, the hardware manager/Agent stack is responsible for breaking up all the Memory resources the adapter presents to the fabric into homogeneous memory resource pools. Some FAM devices may declare their memory resources as specific commercially available memory devices (e.g.,  DDR5 DIMM devices, Optane NVDIMMs). Some FAM devices may declare their memory resources as different quantities of generic memory media types (e.g.,  volatile RAM, persistent RAM, persistent block-mode storage). Homogeneous Memory resources may be modelled using any applicable Redfish Memory object. Non-homogeneous Memory resources shall be modelled as an appropriate number of homogeneous Memory resources.</p>
<p>After creating the appropriate homogeneous Memory resource objects for a Fabric Adapter, <strong>the hardware manager/Agent stack shall create one or more homogeneous Memory Domains linked to appropriate collections of the Fabric Adapter’s Memory resource objects.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Any Fabric Adapter which acts as a producer of FAM resources to the fabric thus shall have navigation links to one or more <em>homogeneous</em> Memory Domain objects.</strong></p>
<p>If the hardware manager/Agent stack has an a priori plan that dictates how one or more of a FAM module Fabric Adapter’s Memory Domains are to be split up into individual Memory Chunks, <strong>the hardware manager/Agent stack shall create the desired pre-defined Memory Chunks</strong>. If there are no a priori plans that dictate allocation of Memory Chunks from the various Memory Domains, <strong>the hardware manager/Agent stack shall not create the Memory Chunks collection or any default Memory Chunk instances.</strong> Their existence at the first appearance (creation time) of a FAM module will imply such memory allocations are reserved and not available to Clients of the Sunfish Redfish Service.</p>
<h4 id="7121-sunfish-interpretation-of-redfish-fam-object-properties">7.1.2.1. Sunfish Interpretation of Redfish FAM Object Properties</h4>
<p>The Redfish properties for all the objects which Sunfish recognizes as describing FAM sources or producers on a fabric are defined in the Redfish Resource and Schema Guide (see TBD). However, sometimes the flexibility of the Redfish definitions can lead to confusion or inconsistencies in their use by different creators. Therefore the Sunfish Framework is dictating specific rules for meaning <em>and usage</em> of some properties. Some such rules apply to properties associated with the general object outside the context of a specific fabric (e.g.,  any of Ethernet, Infiniband, SAS, etc) and some rules apply to the general property within the context of a specific fabric (e.g.,  only CXL, only Infiniband), and some rules apply only to properties or whole objects that are unique to a specific fabric.</p>
<p>In the following tables, the column header definitions apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Property:</strong> Nominally just the name of a Property as found in the Redfish Resource and Schema Guide tables under the 'Property' column. In the Redfish guide, rather than a simple name assigned to a 'string', 'boolean', or 'ordinal', some properties are really the JSON descriptions of arrays of URIs or key, value pairs, etc. To save space, our 'Property' column will include a 'file system directory format' for such nested objects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For example, the structure:</p>
<p>Links {
Endpoints [ {
@odata.id
} ]</p>
<p>}</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>would be depicted in the following Sunfish tables as</p>
<p>​	Links/Endpoints</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Opt/Req:</strong>  Redfish makes many properties of objects optional.  Sunfish is more particular about the presence of some properties.  The value in this column indicates the requirement of this Property in the Sunfish Framework:
<ul>
<li><strong>Optional:</strong>  (Opt) Sunfish does not require this Property be present, but when it is present any requirements in the Notes column apply.</li>
<li><strong>Required:</strong>  (Req) Sunfish requires this Property be present for the object to meet Sunfish's definition of 'complete'.  If this Property is not present, the Sunfish or the Sunfish Agents may reject any POST, PATCH or PUT requests directed to this object because a complete description is required to perform the request properly.</li>
<li><strong>Conditionally Required:</strong>  In some situations this Property is Required.  Often applied to 'Links' to related objects.  E.g., CXL SLD or MLD devices need one or more CXLLogicalDevices linked to the FabricAdapter which represents the physical Endpoint to the fabric.</li>
<li><strong>Prohibited:</strong>  In some situations this Property is Prohibited.  The value may be meaningless or ambiguous.  In the case of links, some navigation links would imply improper relationships or circular definitions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Client/Agent:</strong>  Indicates the entity that is normally expected to declare the value of the given Property.  This column is only a guideline.  Normative requirements, if any, may appear only the Notes column.
<ul>
<li><strong>Client:</strong>  indicates that the Sunfish Client either establishes the original value of the Property, or is allowed to over write existing defaults or values originally established by the Agent / hardware manager stack.</li>
<li><strong>Agent:</strong> indicates that the Agent / hardware manager stack is expected to supply the original value of this property when it was created and passed into Sunfish by the Agent.</li>
<li><strong>Agent crawlout:</strong>  indicates that the Agent / hardware manager stack is required to supply the original value of this property when the Agent passes the original object to Sunfish.  This Property is usually a hardware declared value or is a value established by the hardware manager during the fabric crawl out and base configuration phase.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Notes:</strong>  This column describes the Sunfish specific extension, explanation, or interpretation of the purpose of this Redfish property.  If the definition is the same as found in the Redfish Resource and Schema Guide, then this column should be indicating addition details about how Sunfish will use this value, or describe policies related to processing specific values or changes of values.  <em>This column may contain normative requirements.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>In the following tables the term &quot;<strong>UUID-formatted</strong>&quot; refers to a 16-byte identifier formatted as a UUID string.  The 16-byte value does not need to meet the IEEE definition of a UUID (IE, it is not a Sunfish requirement that this identifier meet the IEEE UUID requirements).  To meet the Sunfish requirements, the 16-byte value shall be unique within the scope of the Redfish URI namespace listed in the Notes column.</p>

<td>For ZoneType == 'Zone of Endpoints' or 'Zones of Zones', setting this flag to 'True' informs the Agent / hardware manager stack that the Client is not going to define the routing of paths between the Endpoint members of this Zone, and that the Agent / hardware manager stack is to use a fabric-specific default routing algorithm to do so. For these ZoneTypes, if this Property is set to 'False',  the Agent / hardware manager stack and the Client are responsible to coordinate a custom routing policy.     <br><br>For ZoneType == 'Default Zone',  Sunfish assumes that if DefaultRoutingEnable == 'True', Agents / hardware managers are expected to route traffic to/from any / all  Endpoints in the Default Zone.  **In a CXL fabric, Sunfish requires that the Default Zone shall set this Property to 'False' so that Endpoints in the CXL Default Zone are isolated from one another until a Client moves them to another Zone. **</td>
